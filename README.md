# streamlit_playground




This playground is intended to explore Streamlit potential in non conventional contexts. 

Some ideas surfaced in my mind as I was participating in the PROCERGS DATATHON. We had the urge to present our idea in a more concrete way and had no front/mobile dev in our team to do so, and I wondered if we could, for example, use Streamlit to deliver an iteractive mock-like POC or even deliver stable cross plataform applications.

Why not?
